# 3D_Model_Unzipper

## Purpose
This simply scans my downloads folder for any .zip archives, then opens them and searches for .stl or .obj files. 
If it locates any then it removes, any superfluous numbers (Thingiverse adds numbers to the beginning of all the files), unzips the archive into the 3D printing folder
on my desktop, and deletes the original archive. In one fell swoop, helping keep more organized AND saving me time!
